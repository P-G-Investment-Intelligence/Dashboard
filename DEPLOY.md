# Deploying Your P&G Dashboard

To make your dashboard accessible publicly on the internet, you need to host the static files generated by the build process.

## Step 1: Create a Production Build
First, ensure you have the latest version of your app built for production. This creates an optimized folder called `dist`.

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will update the `dist` folder in your project directory (`C:\Users\Jayanth\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\pg_dashboard\dist`).

## Step 2: Choose a Hosting Method

### Option A: The Easiest Way (Drag & Drop) - Recommended for Quick Demos
1. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. If you don't have an account, you may need to sign up (it's free).
3. Open your file explorer to your project folder:
   `C:\Users\Jayanth\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\pg_dashboard`
4. Drag and drop the **`dist`** folder (not the whole project folder) onto the Netlify page.
5. Netlify will upload the files and give you a live URL (e.g., `https://calm-sea-123.netlify.app`).

### Option B: The Professional Way (Vercel) - Recommended for Long-term
Vercel is the company behind Next.js and offers excellent hosting for React apps.

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. **Deploy**:
   Run this command in your project root:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Set up and deploy: `Y`
   - Which scope: (Select your account)
   - Link to existing project: `N`
   - Project name: `pg-dashboard`
   - Directory: `./` (default)
   - Review build settings: `N` (Defaults are correct for Vite)

   Vercel will build and deploy your site, providing a production URL (e.g., `https://pg-dashboard.vercel.app`).

### Option C: GitHub Pages (Free & Integrated)
If you are pushing this code to GitHub, you can use GitHub Pages.

1. Create a repository on GitHub and push your code.
2. Go to Repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Source: `GitHub Actions` (or configure a workflow to build and deploy the `dist` folder).
   *Note: This requires a bit more configuration with Vite.*
